# AI query log file

#### General AI development guidelines:
- Create `ai/PROGRESS.md`, and keep it updated when you complete steps.
- You may refer to `ai/refrences` for code examples of other plugins or extra documentation provided for this task.
- When writing code, follow these guidelines:
  - Always prefer the early-return pattern to reduce nesting of `if`s, etc.
  - Similarly, prefer `if …` -> `continue`/`return`/`break` early in loops over large nested blocks.
- _If_ the project requires a frontend, use Vue, TS, and SCSS for that.
  - Prefer using `<script setup lang="ts">` style single file components.
  - Use proper TypeScript type hinting.
- _If_ the project requires a backend, use modern Python `3.14+` for that.
  - Do proper type hinting with full type annotations.
  - For type-hinting, prefer the native types (e.g. `dict[str, int]` over the older `typing.*` aliases like `Dict[AnyStr, int]`)
  - Prefer async programming where possible.
  - For web stuff: `FastApi`
  - For postgres: typed `sqlalchemy`
    - For migrations: `alembic`
- Write tests for both frontend and backend parts.
- Remember to update the `/CHANGELOG.md` and `/README.md` if existent (including other pre-existing documentation).
- If you want to write Markdown summaries of the task you just did (only if specifically asked for by the user!) write those to `ai/summaries/` folder, and never into the root folder.
  - However, usually you don't need to write Markdown summaries.
- Please prefer to use the read file tool over weird constructs with `cat` etc. Terminal should not be needed for searches most of the time, either.
